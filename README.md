🚦 Global Traffic Accident Analysis – Python Dashboard Project
This project presents a comprehensive Python-based interactive dashboard for analyzing global traffic accident data. It reveals key trends related to road conditions, weather, time of day, and causes, while pinpointing accident hotspots through geospatial visualizations.

🔍 Key Objectives
Analyze accident frequency by weather and road conditions

Visualize time-of-day patterns to identify high-risk hours

Identify top contributing causes to road casualties

Map accident hotspots using geographic data

Compare accident rates across various environmental factors

📊 Dashboard Features
📍 Geospatial Map: Accident hotspot detection using Folium/Plotly Mapbox

🌧 Weather Analysis: Donut + stacked bar charts for conditions like Rain, Snow, Fog

🛣 Road Condition Analysis: Bar chart comparing Dry, Wet, Gravel, etc. vs accident counts

⏰ Time of Day: Area or line chart showing accident spikes over 24 hours

⚠ Cause of Accidents: Bar chart of major causes (Speeding, Distraction, Drunk Driving)

📌 KPIs: Total Accidents, Total Casualties, Avg. Casualties per Incident, Top Cause

🧰 Tools & Technologies Used
pandas, numpy – Data cleaning and transformation

matplotlib, seaborn, plotly – Advanced visualizations

Streamlit / Dash – Interactive dashboard building

Folium / Plotly Express – Geo-mapping accident hotspots

Dataset: Global traffic accident data (CSV/JSON format)

📈 Key Insights
Speeding is the top global cause of fatal accidents

Accidents are more frequent during early morning and late-night hours

Adverse weather (Rain, Fog) significantly raises accident rates

Wet and under-construction roads are high-risk environments

Certain regions exhibit dense clustering of serious incidents

🚀 Future Improvements
Integrate real-time weather or traffic feeds via APIs

Use machine learning models to predict high-risk zones

Deploy as a web app with real-time alerts and analytics
